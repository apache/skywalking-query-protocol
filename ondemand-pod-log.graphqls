# Ondemand Pod log: fetch the Pod logs on users' demand, the logs
# are fetched and displayed in real time, and are not persisted
# in any kind. This is helpful when users want to do some experiments
# and monitor the logs and see what's happing inside the service.
# Note: if you print secrets in the logs they are also visible to
# the UI so this feature is disabled by default, please read the
# configuration documentation to enable this manually.
