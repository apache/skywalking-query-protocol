# Metrics v2 query protocol is an alternative metrics query(s) of original v1,
# defined in the metric.graphql, top-n-records.graphqls, and aggregation.graphqls.
# By leveraging the new ID rule(no register) in the v8, we could query metrics based on name(s) directly.

# Metrics type is a new concept since v8.

    # Label should be assigned before the query happens, such as at the setting stage
    LABELED_VALUE
    # Heatmap value suitable for readHeatMap
    HEATMAP
    # Top metrics is for readSampledRecords only.
