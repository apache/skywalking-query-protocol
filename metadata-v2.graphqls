# Metadata query v2 protocol provides the layer-based query to various services monitored by SkyWalking ecosystem.

# In the v9 core, v1 protocol is provided on the top of the v2 implementation.

# Each service would have native definition about instance and endpoint.

# Service is a logic concept, representing a collection of runnable context.
